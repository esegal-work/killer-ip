# killer-ip

I had some time while watching a seminar (something about communications and being present in the moment, idk) and got tired of all this “[Graphical user interface interface to track a killer’s IP address]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU))” nonsense that nobody seems to have done anything about.
[So I did something about it.](https://esegal-work.github.io/killer-ip/)
